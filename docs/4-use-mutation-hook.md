## useMutation Hooks

usage of `useMutation<StoreProps, Error, StoreProps>` in your code and why `StoreProps` appears twice. Let's break it down:

In the `useMutation` hook from React Query, the type parameters are defined as follows:

`useMutation<TData, TError, TVariables, TContext>`

- `TData`: The type of successful response data
- `TError`: The type of error
- `TVariables`: The type of variables you pass to the mutation function
- `TContext`: (Optional) The type of the context

**In your case, you're using:**
`useMutation<StoreProps, Error, StoreProps>`

**Let's break down why `StoreProps` appears twice:**

1. **The first `StoreProps` (TData):**
   This represents the type of data that the mutation will return on success. In your case, the `createStore` function is expected to return a `StoreProps` object when the store is successfully created.
2. **`Error` (TError):**
   This is the standard JavaScript `Error` type, which represents the error that might occur during the mutation.
3. **The second `StoreProps` (TVariables):**
   This represents the type of data that you pass to the mutation function (`createStore`). In your case, you're passing a `StoreProps` object to create a new store.

The reason `StoreProps` is used for both the input and output is that often, when creating a new resource, the API returns the newly created resource, which has the same shape as the input data (possibly with some additional fields like `id` filled in by the server).

Your `StoreProps` interface is defined as:

```js
export interface StoreProps {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  userId?: string;
}
```

This means:

- When creating a store, you might send `{ name: "My Store", userId: "user123" }`
- The server might respond with `{ id: "store456", name: "My Store", userId: "user123" }`

Both the input and output conform to the `StoreProps` interface, which is why it's used twice in the `useMutation` type parameters.

To make this more explicit, you could define separate types:

```js
interface CreateStoreInput {
  name: string;
  userId?: string;
}

interface CreateStoreOutput {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  userId: string;
}

useMutation<CreateStoreOutput, Error, CreateStoreInput>
```

However, using `StoreProps` for both is simpler if the types are indeed the same or very similar.

Your `useCreateStore` hook is well-structured. It handles the mutation, success toast, error toast, and navigation to the new store page. The usage of `window.location.assign(`/$data?.id`)` ensures that the URL is updated after the store is created .

If you want to improve this further, you might consider:

1. Using Next.js's `useRouter` for navigation instead of `window.location.assign()` for a smoother client-side transition.
2. Updating any local cache or state with the new store data on success.
3. Possibly adding a loading state to disable the form while the mutation is in progress
